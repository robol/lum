LDAP USER MANAGER

1. What is LUM?

LUM, or Ldap User Manager aims to be a simple graphic interface
to manage Ldap Accounts in the GNOME desktop. 
It hasn't many feature at the moment being, but is quite
simple to setup and should bring you everything you need
if you just add/remove/change users and groups in an LDAP
directory.

There are not so many tools to achieve this, and many of them
are web frontend (that I don't like much) or are generic LDAP
tool. These one are in fact more powerful than LUM as they
can manage any type of data, but are less simple because you
have to struggle with LDAP syntax. 

LUM aims to be simple and with an hassle-free setup. 

2. Hot do I install it?

You can easily run it from its own directory launching

 ./lum.py

It is the only supported method right now, but I will
include a setup.py as soon as I got it quite stable
to release a 0.1 tarball.

You will need the following python modules:

 gtk (>= 2.16) , ldap, crypt, gnomekeyring

and If you use Ubuntu or Debian you can get them
with:

 sudo apt-get install python-gtk2 python-ldap python-crypto python-gnomekeyring

3. Bug reporting

There is not a bug tracker right now, but if you manage
to find one you can write to me at this address:
