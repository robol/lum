LDAP USER MANAGER
Developed by Leonardo Robol <robol@poisson.phc.unipi.it>

1. What is LUM?

LUM, or Ldap User Manager aims to be a simple graphic interface
to manage Ldap Accounts in the GNOME desktop. 
It hasn't many feature at the moment being, but is quite
simple to setup and should bring you everything you need
if you just add/remove/change users and groups in an LDAP
directory.

There are not so many tools to achieve this, and many of them
are web frontend (that I don't like much) or are generic LDAP
tool. These one are in fact more powerful than LUM as they
can manage any type of data, but are less simple because you
have to struggle with LDAP syntax. 

LUM aims to be simple and with an hassle-free setup. 

2. Hot do I install it?

You can easily run it from its own directory launching

 ./lum.py

You can install it system-wide with the following
command:

 python setup.py install

with root privileges. Ubuntu users can get the packaged
version via the PPA:

 sudo apt-add-repository ppa:leo.robol/lum
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install lum

Only the "stable" versions are packaged there, so if you
want to follow every improvemente you should use the git
repository on github.com.

You will need the following python modules:

 gtk (>= 2.16) , ldap, crypt, gnomekeyring

and If you use Ubuntu or Debian you can get them
with:

 sudo apt-get install python-gtk2 python-ldap python-crypto python-gnomekeyring
