1. What is LUM?

LUM, or Ldap User Manager aims to be a simple graphic interface
to manage Ldap Accounts in the GNOME desktop. 
It hasn't many feature at the moment being, but is quite
simple to setup and should bring you everything you need
if you just add/remove/change users and groups in an LDAP
directory.

There are not so many tools to achieve this, and many of them
are web frontend (that I don't like much) or are generic LDAP
tool. These one are in fact more powerful than LUM as they
can manage any type of data, but are less simple because you
have to struggle with LDAP syntax. 

LUM aims to be simple and with an hassle-free setup.
